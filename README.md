# Image Capturing AI with BLIP

This project provides an image captioning system built with **Gradio** for the user interface and **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)** for image captioning. The project contains three main Python files to capture, caption, and interface with images using deep learning models from the **Hugging Face Transformers** library.

## Project Structure

- `Image_capturing_AI.py`: Contains the core logic for capturing images and preparing them for processing.
- `Image_capturing_AI_Gradio.py`: Implements a simple Gradio interface for image upload and caption generation.
- `Image_capturing_AI_combine.py`: Combines the image capturing and captioning with a full Gradio interface, providing a complete, functional image captioning tool.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/STV1222/Image_capturing_GenAI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Image_capturing_GenAI
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio transformers Pillow
   ```

## Usage

You can run the combined file `Image_capturing_AI_combine.py` to start the Gradio interface for image captioning:

```bash
python Image_capturing_AI_combine.py
```

This will launch a local web server where you can upload an image and receive an AI-generated caption using the **BLIP model**.

## Example

1. Run the script.
2. Upload an image in the Gradio interface.
3. Get a caption generated by the BLIP model.

## File Descriptions

- **`Image_capturing_AI_combine.py`**: 
  This is the main script of the project, which integrates the BLIP image captioning model from Hugging Face with a user-friendly Gradio interface. It loads an image, generates a caption, and returns the result.

- **`Image_capturing_AI.py`**: 
  This file contains the core image capturing logic.

- **`Image_capturing_AI_Gradio.py`**: 
  This file provides a simplified Gradio interface for uploading an image and receiving a caption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Gradio
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PIL (Pillow)
